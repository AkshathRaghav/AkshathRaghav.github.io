This page outlines some of the work I'm doing at [The Dow Chemical Company](https://www.dow.com/en-us.html) (Fall '25-) as a Student Project Manager. 

* Leading 12-member team to develop an AI Platform – replacing Analytical Science’s (AS) legacy LIMS – for automating chemical Studies.
* Built an agent orchestration layer (via Docker & SLURM) for dynamic startup, reproducible sandboxing & traceability w/ MLflow.
* Architecting full-stack layer integrating FastAPI backend, Dash frontend, LangGraph/DSPy agents & DuckDB vector search on RCAC Anvil.

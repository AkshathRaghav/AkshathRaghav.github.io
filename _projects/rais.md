This page expands upon the work I did at the [CVES Group](https://yhlu.net/) (Spring '24), where I led a team to build a workflow to evaluate factors affecting **practical** reproducibility in AI/ML Research projects. 

* Summarized SWE Research papers pertaining to reproducibility and reusability of ML code and identified common trends in findings. Formulated the problem as one that requires a reverse-MLOps perspective. 
* Built efficient scrapers for research paper archives and common ML repositories. Extracted data from 3000+ commerical and academic organizations to statistically back our proposed evaluation pipeline. 

You can find the code [here]().

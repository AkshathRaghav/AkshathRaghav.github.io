To address this, accurate fire prediction and forecast outlooks are crucial for effective mitigation. Agencies like the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) and the Canadian Wildland Fire Information System (CWFIS) provide vital fire risk assessments. In this paper, our main goal was to demonstrate the sufficiency of **seasonality** in fire risk forecasting. Two encoding methods, One-Shot and Year-By-Year, used for encoding the seasonal changes of fire weather, were analyzed for their implications in fire risk assessment, revealing contrasting attributes. The findings guide model design improvements, bolstering wildfire management and protection measures. </div> </div> <h1 id="understanding-the-why">Understanding the ‚ÄòWhy?‚Äô</h1> <p>Recent fire incidents have resulted in tragic loss of life, such as the Black Summer of 2019-2020 in Australia, where an estimated 33 people perished, and extensive damage to land and homes, with 18.6 million hectares consumed by flames (Parrott et al., 2021). In early 2021, wildfires ravaged approximately 7.13 million acres in the United States (Statista, 2022), while Algeria experienced a prolonged system of wildfires that took the lives of at least 70 people (Reuters, 2021). The financial toll is equally significant, with the 2018 California Camp Fire alone incurring losses exceeding $16.5 billion (Los Angeles Times, 2019).</p> <p>These losses are primarily attributed to the destruction of residential and commercial structures, including homes, businesses, and infrastructure. The costs also encompassed expenses related to emergency response efforts, rehabilitation, and restoration of the affected areas. In the coming days, resources from all over the Western United States would be sent to Paradise to assist in the fight to contain the fire. In the aftermath of the wildfire, resources from across the Western United States were mobilized to support firefighting efforts in Paradise (Town of Paradise, n.d.). By November 10th, the response included a force of 5,596 firefighters, 622 engines, 75 water tenders, 101 fire crews, 103 bulldozers, and 24 helicopters working diligently to contain the fire (Town of Paradise, n.d.). These statistics highlight the urgent need for comprehensive fire risk forecasting and management strategies to protect lives, infrastructure, and ecosystems.</p> <h1 id="north-american-region-overview">North American Region Overview</h1> <blockquote> <p>‚ÄúDuring the winter months ‚Ä¶ fire activity is concentrated in the SouthWest and South areas.

This difference is further highlighted by the smaller interquartile range in the Year-By-Year plot for the same three risk values.</p> <p>The nature of the Year-By-Year encoding method becomes evident when considering a geo-location that incrementally experienced extreme fire risk over the month of July across different years. With Year-By-Year encoding, the risk level values assigned to the month of July vary based on previous years, capturing changes in the fire risk trend. In the early years, these values would be lower but would go on increasing sharply during the later years.</p> <p>In contrast, the One-Shot encoding assigns the same values to the month of July across all years, potentially overlooking the historical changes in fire risk trends. Despite this, our results, discussed later on, showcase the good accuracy achieved by both encoding methods, indicating the overall season‚Äôs reliability in modeling fire risk historically.</p> <hr> <h1 id="results">Results</h1> <p>Here are how our results compare with the real FWI maps during 2022.</p> <img-comparison-slider> <figure slot="first"> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/ambee/2/image_part_001-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/ambee/2/image_part_001-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/ambee/2/image_part_001-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/ambee/2/image_part_001.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null;

Our model accurately distinguishes positive fire risk (High and Extreme) from negative fire risk (No and Low) during winter and spring seasons. Conversely, the model performs well in classifying positive fire risk during months with higher fire-prone coverage but struggles with negative fire risk. In conclusion, both models tend to overestimate fire risk during the Summer and Autumn seasons, while maintaining high accuracy in predicting high and extreme risk coverage throughout all months.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/ambee/plots/feature/image22-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/ambee/plots/feature/image22-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/ambee/plots/feature/image22-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/ambee/plots/feature/image22.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="example image" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> <p>Furthermore, upon analyzing the two models - using One-Shot and Year-By-Year encoding methods - we observe distinct patterns in their importance attribution. The first model heavily emphasizes the ‚Äòmonth_encoded‚Äô risk levels for the next month, as expected, since it aims to predict the risk level for the subsequent period. Conversely, it assigns relatively less importance to the current month‚Äôs ‚Äòmonth_encoded‚Äô risk levels and overall risk ‚Äòpercentage‚Äô levels.</p> <p>An interesting thing to note is that the One-Shot model places a lower emphasis on the ‚Äògeo‚Äô, ‚ÄòECO_ID‚Äô, and ‚ÄòBIOME_NUM‚Äô features, which can be interpreted as the model‚Äôs ability to generalize over the entire region, regardless of the fuel type and land over, while focusing purely on the historical nature of the data.</p> <p>On the other hand, the second model also prioritizes the ‚Äòmonth_encoded‚Äô values for the next month, while also placing greater importance on the ‚ÄòExtreme Risk‚Äô encoded values. Interestingly, it attributes a comparatively higher significance to the ‚ÄòNo Risk‚Äô and ‚ÄòExtreme Risk‚Äô values for both the current month‚Äôs ‚Äòmonth_encoded‚Äô risk levels and risk ‚Äòpercentage‚Äô levels. This observation could be attributed to the consistent prevalence of ‚ÄòNo Risk‚Äô levels across a significant portion of the North American region throughout the entire training data period.</p> <p>But, the important observation here is the ability of the model to prioritize the ‚ÄòExtreme Risk‚Äô level more, since the areas which generally have an extreme fire risk have consistently high ‚Äòmonth_encoded‚Äô values for the same.</p> <p>Overall, both models demonstrate a common focus on predicting the risk level for the next month, while accounting for the unique characteristics of the North American Region.</p> <p>In order to showcase the accuracy and performance of our fire risk prediction models, as a whole, we consider a real-life example of how these models would be used. First, we trained the model using data up to May 2023 only. Subsequently, we put the model to the test by predicting fire risk values for the next two months, June and July, of the same year. By comparing these predictions with the actual fire risk values observed to date, we have generated the following accuracy comparison plots and tables.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/ambee/last-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/ambee/last-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/ambee/last-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/ambee/last.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="example image" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> <p>Our test comparing the prediction of real-time July 2023 data with both the One-Shot and Year-By-Year models revealed compelling insights.

Conversely, we found that the fire risk reduces in Arizona and some parts of Texas in August. Notably, the central region of California exhibits lower risk compared to its surrounding areas, a trend also evident in our model‚Äôs plots.</p> <p>To gain deeper insights, we compared our plots for July and August, focusing on areas of significant change and cross-referencing with the NIFC August relative fire outlook.

Noteworthy regions with greater fire outlook include parts of Utah and Arizona. In New Mexico, our model places the region at moderate risk for both months, consistent with the relative NIFC plots.</p> <p>These consistent and validated observations reinforce the high accuracy and reliability of our model‚Äôs fire risk predictions when compared to the widely recognized NIFC agency‚Äôs forecast maps for the United States.</p> <hr> <h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1> <p>The next steps forward involve integrating forecasted weather data, along with crucial factors such as drought, lightning, and extreme weather events, to create a more comprehensive and robust predictive model.

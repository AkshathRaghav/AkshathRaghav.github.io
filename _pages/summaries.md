Quick takes and **visual breakdowns** of papers I've read or worked on, mainly in DL. These aren't detailed summaries or repetitions from the papers; instead, they focus on simplifying the key points that caught my interest, evaluating how they work and how to make them work for you. Absorbing the content and replicating it is a great skill. This series aims to track my own understanding and academic journey while offering others a glimpse into papers worth exploring.

For ease of navigation, I've also categorized the papers and the general areas that they fall under.

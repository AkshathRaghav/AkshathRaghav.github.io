I'm a **final-year** student @ Purdue, majoring in Electrical & Computer Engineering.

I’m passionate about developing robust, user-facing solutions that combine explainable learning algorithms, seamless system interoperability, and hardware–software co‑optimized platforms.

I'm excited about AI Accelerator Microarch, ML Compilers and Data-Center Infrastructure. Feel free to reach out to me at [araviki[at]purdue[dot]edu](mailto:araviki@purdue.edu).

## background 

* S'25: Worked under the AI Hardware Team at SoCET, and am responsible for a few [parameterizable IPs](https://akshathraghav.github.io/projects/amp) used in the AMP0 and AMP1 Tensor-Cores. Implemented the [Gustavson-based Sparse Mat-Mul benchmarks](https://akshathraghav.github.io/projects/gpuv3) for the SoCET GPU team's V3 architecture.  Completed my Capstone project (through ECE 49022), and won the Senior Design award for the [BoilerNet system](https://akshathraghav.github.io/projects/boilernet). Led the backend team under [(Beck's Hybrids)-sponsored project](https://akshathraghav.github.io/projects/becks) through the Data Mine. Funded by HII to work on a custom FFT-accelerator ASIC.
* F'24: Joined the Purdue SoCET Team as a Teaching Assistant. Joined the I-GUIDE Team as a Research Assistant (TDM HDR Fellowship), where we worked on scaling a HPC workflow for [distributed inference](https://akshathraghav.github.io/projects/I-GUIDE) on Apache Spark (+Sedona) through GCP (accepted at I-GUIDE Forum '25).
* Smr'24: Joined the Purdue SoCET group, in the Digital Design team. Over the summer, I added the [Zicond Extension](https://github.com/riscvarchive/riscv-zicond/) to the [RISCV core](https://github.com/Purdue-SoCET/RISCVBusiness/tree/rv32zc) for the AFTx07 tape-out. Interned at [VLSI System Design](https://www.vlsisystemdesign.com/), where I implemented the [TinySpeech](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.04245) family of speech recognition models for their [vsdsquadronmini boad](https://www.vlsisystemdesign.com/vsdsquadronmini/). I also wrote an [ANSI-C based inference engine](https://github.com/AkshathRaghav/tinyspeech) which runs out-of-box in 8bit precision, with 91%+ accuracies for embedded inference. 
* F'23 - S'24: Worked at the [Duality Lab](https://davisjam.github.io/), where [we re-engineered](https://akshathraghav.github.io/projects/maskformer/) the MaskFormer segmentation model **(funded by Google!)** from the [PyTorch-based artifact](https://github.com/facebookresearch/MaskFormer) to TensorFlow for publishing to the TF Model Garden. You can find our **paper** [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.18801) and code [here](https://github.com/PurdueDualityLab/tf-maskformer/tree/PR_Draft/models/official/projects/maskformer). I also generated figures for the [PeaTMOSS paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.00699.pdf) (accepted at MSR'24).
* S'24: Led a project at the [CVES](https://yhlu.net/research.html) group @ Purdue ECE, where our goal was to define and evaluate reproducibility within AI/ML projects. I wrote the [codebase](https://github.com/AkshathRaghav/RAIS) for building our pipeline and statistically [defined](https://akshathraghav.github.io/projects/rais/) the importance of parameters. 
* S'24: I was involved in MultiModal (LM) understanding projects at the [e-lab](https://e-lab.github.io/). I've built [eugenie](https://akshathraghav.github.io/projects/eugenie/) & [grammarflow](https://akshathraghav.github.io/projects/grammarflow/).
* S'23 - Smr'23: Interned at [Ambee](https://www.getambee.com/), where I deployed a worldwide [fire forecasting system (F3)](https://akshathraghav.github.io/projects/ambee/) into their API and wrote automated scripts for their environment-data focused [data lakes](https://www.getambee.com/api-documentation) (still in use). You can find the **whitepaper** [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/372769364_Time-Driven_Fire_Risk_Forecasting_Leveraging_Historical_Trends_for_Enhanced_Seasonal_Modeling) and access the API [here](https://www.getambee.com/api-documentation).
* F'22 - S'23: Helped lead a project supervised by Prof. [Yuan Wang](https://wang-lab.stanford.edu/people/yuan-wang) (currently at Stanford) where we aimed to correlate [lightning activity with wildfire spread](https://akshathraghav.github.io/projects/lwl/). Wrote (big-)data-interfacing code for satellites across EUR/EUS/SAR, and was responsible for packing them to use within a ConvLSTM model from [DeepCube's short-term forecasting](https://github.com/DeepCube-org/uc3-public-notebooks/blob/main/3_UC3_DL_models_XAI.ipynb).

<!-- ## interests

At the highest level, I'm super excited about the [Partner as a Product (PaaP)](https://uxdesign.cc/this-is-the-moment-to-reinvent-your-product-1ee084e38ab1) era we're entering into. I hope to gain experience across the systems we ('re going to) base our lives on, from hardware-level programming to cloud-based HA lifecycles. Majoring in ECE gives me the oppurtunity to develop myself in these areas. 

More specifically, I work with language models and learning algorithms. I like to augment intelligence in LLMs, as opposed to using them as a general purpose solution (which it's not). I approach any AI problem (overarching the ML bubble) as a toddler trying to learn -- by using their senses and the environment. I believe the future of intelligence will come from making machines self-aware of their need to integrate with other machines.  -->

<!-- Going forward, I aim to specialize in the art of **solution-building**, by bridging happening research with dynamic market needs. My approach involves deep-diving into research to understand core principles thoroughly and then 'swimming' across to explore its applications, ensuring my projects are both **fundamentally robust and practically relevant**. -->
<!-- 
Lessons from my mentors: 
- *Reliable software is a by-product of a robust design process;*
- *Quality work is replicable, replicable work guarantees quality;*
- *If it's not use(d)(ful), what's the point of building it?* -->
<!-- - *Every unexplained idea in one field can be explained by another;* -->

## extras

In my free time, I enjoy [photography](https://akshathraghav.github.io/photography/), reading manga, speed typing (130+ wpm), and whittling. 

I can speak English, Hindi, Tamil, and Kannada. Currently, I'm learning German and ASL. 

I enjoy Bowling, Billiards and Golf. I follow the NBA (Warriors) and IPL (RCB).

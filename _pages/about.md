I'm a second-year undergraduate @ Purdue, pursuing a B.Sc in CompE.

My primary interest revolves arould building robust user-facing solutions at the intersection of applied AI, reproducible (open-source) softwares and interoperablility principles. I enjoy research-driven environments aimed at taking concepts to tangible products. 

<b>Automatability</b>, <b>replicability</b> and <b>accessability</b> remain the core of my work. 

Current (Updated 3/1): 
<ul>
    <li>Building a package for constraining LLM outputs within agent chains, </li>
    <li>Estimating the transferrability of PTMs,</li>
    <li>Developing an automated pipeline for evaluating the reproducibility of ML experiments.</li>
    <li>Constructing multi-tool autonomous agents.</li>
</ul>

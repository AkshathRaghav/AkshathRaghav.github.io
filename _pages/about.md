I'm a second-year undergraduate @ Purdue, pursuing a B.Sc in CompE.

My primary interest revolves arould building robust user-facing solutions at the intersection of applied AI, explainable learning paradigms and interoperablile systems. I enjoy research-driven environments aimed at taking concepts to tangible products. 

<b>Automatability</b>, <b>reproducibility</b> and <b>accessability</b> remain the core of my work. 

> Translations: *I hate doing the same thing thrice; Quality work is replicable, replicable work guarantees quality; If it's not use(d)(ful), what's the point of building it?*

I'm currently looking to involved in the following: 
- *Vision Generation Algorithms*, 
- *Robot-Environment Interactions*, 
- *GPU Programming*, 
- *Digital Design ↔️ ML/DL*. 

I'd highly appreciate any mentorship or suggestions for research labs @ Purdue that focus on these topics!

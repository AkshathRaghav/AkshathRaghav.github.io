I'm a second-year undergraduate @ Purdue, pursuing a B.Sc in Computer Engineering (w/ AIML). 

My primary interest revolves arould building robust user-facing solutions at the intersection of applied AI, reproducible (open-source) softwares and interoperablility principles. I enjoy research-driven environments aimed at taking concepts to tangible products. Automatability, replicability and accessability remain the core of my work. 

I'm currently building a package for LLM constraining, a method for estimating transferrability of PTMs, an automated pipeline for evaluating the reproducibility of ML experiments, and building multi-tool autonomous agents. 

I intend to get into 3-D reconstruction, self-aware robotics and video generation over the summer of '24.

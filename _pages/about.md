I'm a second-year undergraduate @ Purdue, pursuing a B.Sc in CompE.

My primary interest revolves arould building robust user-facing solutions at the intersection of explainable learning algorithms and interoperable systems. I enjoy research-driven environments aimed at taking concepts to tangible products. 

<b>Automatability</b>, <b>reproducibility</b> and <b>accessability</b> remain the core of my work. 

I'm concurrently working on multimodal document understanding, model-task alignment and integrated tools for AI agents. Post this, I intend to dive into building parallel compute architectures. Feel free to reach out to me at [araviki[at]purdue[dot]edu](mailto:araviki@purdue.edu).

## background 

* F'23 - S'24: I worked at the [Duality Lab](https://davisjam.github.io/), where [we re-engineered](https://akshathraghav.github.io/projects/maskformer/) the MaskFormer segmentation model **(funded by Google!)** from the [PyTorch-based artifact](https://github.com/facebookresearch/MaskFormer) to TensorFlow for publishing to the TF Model Garden. You can find our **paper** [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.18801) and **code** [here](https://github.com/PurdueDualityLab/tf-maskformer/tree/PR_Draft/models/official/projects/maskformer). I also generated figures for the [PeaTMOSS **paper**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.00699.pdf).
* S'24: I'm involved in MultiModal (LM) understanding projects at the [e-lab](https://e-lab.github.io/). I've built [eugenie](https://akshathraghav.github.io/projects/eugenie/) & [grammarflow](https://akshathraghav.github.io/projects/grammarflow/). I am currently working on encoding reading-order patterns within documents ([here's](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x1IE_1NT-UAO7bFtoc_bPNJgqQFA1AXK/view?usp=sharing) my current plan of action), and building a routing-system for multi-modal RAG. 
* S'24: I led a project at the [CVES](https://yhlu.net/research.html) group @ Purdue ECE, where our goal was to define and evaluate reproducibility within AI/ML projects. I wrote the [codebase](https://github.com/AkshathRaghav/RAIS) for building our pipeline and statistically [defined](https://akshathraghav.github.io/projects/rais/) the importance of parameters. 
* S'23 - Smr'23: I was employed at [Ambee](https://www.getambee.com/), where I deployed a worldwide [fire forecasting system (F3)](https://akshathraghav.github.io/projects/ambee/) into their API and wrote automated scripts for their environment-data focused [data lakes](https://www.getambee.com/api-documentation) (still in use). You can find my **LOR** [here](https://akshathraghav.github.io/assets/pdf/AkshathRaghavR_LOR_Ambee.pdf). You can find the **whitepaper** [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/372769364_Time-Driven_Fire_Risk_Forecasting_Leveraging_Historical_Trends_for_Enhanced_Seasonal_Modeling). You can get the data [here](https://www.getambee.com/api-documentation).
* F'22 - S'23: I helped lead a project that was supervised by Prof. [Yuan Wang](https://wang-lab.stanford.edu/people/yuan-wang) (currently at Stanford) where we aimed to correlate [lightning activity with wildfire spread](https://akshathraghav.github.io/projects/lwl/). I wrote (big-)data-interfacing code for satellites across EUR/EUS/SAR, and was responsible for packing them to use within a ConvLSTM model from [DeepCube's short-term forecasting](https://github.com/DeepCube-org/uc3-public-notebooks/blob/main/3_UC3_DL_models_XAI.ipynb).

## interests

At the highest level, I'm super excited about the [Partner as a Product (PaaP)](https://uxdesign.cc/this-is-the-moment-to-reinvent-your-product-1ee084e38ab1) era we're entering into. I hope to gain experience across the systems we ('re going to) base our lives on, from hardware-level programming to cloud-based HA lifecycles. Majoring in ECE gives me the oppurtunity to develop myself in these areas. 

More specifically, I work with language models and learning algorithms. I like to augment intelligence in LLMs, as opposed to using them as a general purpose solution (which it's not). I approach any AI problem (overarching the ML bubble) as a toddler trying to learn -- by using their senses and the environment. I believe the future of intelligence will come from making machines self-aware of their need to integrate with other machines. 

<!-- Going forward, I aim to specialize in the art of **solution-building**, by bridging happening research with dynamic market needs. My approach involves deep-diving into research to understand core principles thoroughly and then 'swimming' across to explore its applications, ensuring my projects are both **fundamentally robust and practically relevant**. -->
<!-- 
Lessons from my mentors: 
- *Reliable software is a by-product of a robust design process;*
- *Quality work is replicable, replicable work guarantees quality;*
- *If it's not use(d)(ful), what's the point of building it?* -->
<!-- - *Every unexplained idea in one field can be explained by another;* -->

## hobbies 

In my free time, I enjoy [photography](https://akshathraghav.github.io/photography/), reading manga, watching [@Geopold](https://www.youtube.com/@Geopoldd) and speed typing (130+ wpm). At one point, I was religiously keeping up to date with 53 mangas concurrently. 

On Sundays, I meal prep with my roommates; we alternate between cuisines regularly with Thai curries being our favorite. On Saturdays, I play Valorant with my friends till sunrise, or we make banana bread while watching old Telugu movies. During the week, I love cycling back to my dorm with friends and chugging apple juice (Mott's is the best) during dinner.

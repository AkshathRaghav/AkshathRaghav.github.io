I'm a second-year undergraduate @ Purdue, pursuing a B.Sc in CompE.

My primary interest revolves arould building robust user-facing solutions at the intersection of applied AI, explainable learning paradigms and interoperable systems. I enjoy research-driven environments aimed at taking concepts to tangible products. 

<b>Automatability</b>, <b>reproducibility</b> and <b>accessability</b> remain the core of my work. 

I'm currently looking to involved in the following: 
- *Vision Generation Algorithms*, 
- *Robot-Environment Interactions*, 
- *GPU Programming*, 
- *Digital Design ↔️ ML/DL*. 

I'd highly appreciate any mentorship or suggestions for research labs @ Purdue that focus on these topics!

## background 

Currently, I'm (almost done) working at the TFMG Group ([Duality Lab](https://davisjam.github.io/)), where [we've been re-engineering](https://akshathraghav.github.io/projects/maskformer/) the MaskFormer segmentation from the [PyTorch-based artifact](https://github.com/facebookresearch/MaskFormer) to TensorFlow for publishing to the TF Model Garden. I'm also involved in MultiModal (LM) understanding projects at the [e-lab](https://e-lab.github.io/); built {[eugenie](https://akshathraghav.github.io/projects/eugenie/), [grammarflow](https://github.com/e-lab/SyntaxShaper/tree/main)} and am working on a (purely research [idea](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x1IE_1NT-UAO7bFtoc_bPNJgqQFA1AXK/view?usp=sharing)) self-learning document-reading system. Along with this, I led a project at the CVES group, where our goal was to define and evaluate reproducibility within AI/ML projects; wrote the [codebase](https://github.com/AkshathRaghav/RAIS) for data-scraping and defined evaluation parameters with the same. 

Previously, I briefly worked on making improvements changes to the AWS OpenSearch marcobenchmarking project; proposed PRs for throughput efficiency. Before that, I spent the Summer of '23 at [Ambee](https://www.getambee.com/), where I deployed a worldwide [fire forecasting system](https://akshathraghav.github.io/projects/ambee/) into their API and wrote automated scripts for their environment-data focused data lakes. Around the same time, I worked in a project that was supervised by Prof. Yuan Wang (currently at Stanford) where we aimed to correlate [lightning activity with wildfire spread](https://akshathraghav.github.io/projects/lwl/); I wrote data-interfacing code for satellites across EUR/EUS/SAR. 

## interests

I'm super excited about the [Partner as a Product (PaaP)](https://uxdesign.cc/this-is-the-moment-to-reinvent-your-product-1ee084e38ab1) era we're entering into. I aim to gain experience across these systems (that I believe) we're (going to) base our lives on, from hardware-level programming to cloud-based HPA lifecycles. Majoring in ECE gives me the oppurtunity to develop myself in these areas. 

I'd like to specialize to be in the art of *creating* solutions, irrespective of the field. To start from scratch, build useful products that intersects happening research and the ever-changing customer trends, that's what gets me hyped. This is the main reason why I like working in different (fields of) research, because it allows me to maintain a touch of applicability. 

Lessons from my experiences: 
- *Reliable software is a by-product of a robust design process;*
- *Quality work is replicable, replicable work guarantees quality;*
- *If it's not use(d)(ful), what's the point of building it?*
- *Every unexplained idea in one field finds its explanation within another;*
